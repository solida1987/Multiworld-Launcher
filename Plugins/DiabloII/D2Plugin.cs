// IGamePlugin for "Diablo II Archipelago"

// KEY CHANGE from V1 launcher architecture:
// D2Arch_Launcher.exe (standalone C injector) → called by C# launcher
// → did VirtualAllocEx + CreateRemoteThread from a SEPARATE PROCESS
// → AV scanners: "small standalone injector" = high-risk heuristic

// Injection lives HERE, inside D2Plugin (C# P/Invoke inside the main
// launcher process). The 154MB WPF app with proper PE metadata and
// (eventually) a code signature doing CreateRemoteThread is dramatically
// less suspicious than a 40KB standalone injector blob.
// D2Arch_Launcher.exe bootstrap is ELIMINATED for V2.

// IPC CHANGE:
// D2 DLL ↔ TCP socket ↔ ap_bridge.py ↔ AP server (Python subprocess)
// D2 DLL ↔ Named pipe ↔ D2Plugin (C# in launcher) ↔ ApClient ↔ AP server
// (No Python, no subprocess, no TCP port conflict)

// NOTE: The D2 DLL (D2Archipelago.dll) must be updated to open the named
// pipe client instead of its current TCP socket to ap_bridge.py.
// That DLL-side change is tracked in TODO_V2_DLL_BRIDGE.md.
